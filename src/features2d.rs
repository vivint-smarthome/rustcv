/// Class for extracting blobs from an image.
///
/// The class implements a simple algorithm for extracting blobs from an image:
///
/// 1. Convert the source image to binary images by applying thresholding with
/// several thresholds from minThreshold (inclusive) to maxThreshold (exclusive)
/// with distance thresholdStep between neighboring thresholds.
///
/// 2. Extract connected components from every binary image by findContours and
/// calculate their centers.
///
/// 3. Group centers from several binary images by their coordinates. Close
/// centers form one group that corresponds to one blob, which is controlled by
/// the minDistBetweenBlobs parameter.
///
/// 4. From the groups, estimate final centers of blobs and their radiuses and
/// return as locations and sizes of keypoints.
